PROBLEM:Tim is practicing his air hockey skills by taking shots at an unguarded goal . He hits a frictionless puck so it moves very fast directly towards the goal . His little brother Sam , standing on the side of the table , quickly nudges the puck as it passes the center of the table . The nudge is perpendicular to the original path of the puck .
H13:With this kind of nudge , could the puck 's new path ever be perpendicular to its original path ?
A13:no
H12:Let me try again . Which principle can be applied when the motion of an object is complex , for instance , it can be thought of as motion in two perpendicular dimensions ?
A12:decomposition

A10:horizontally vertically
H9:I 'm not sure I understand your input . How about we focus more on our task ?
A9:motion is both horizontal and vertical
H8:In order for the puck 's new path to be completely perpendicular to its original path toward the goal , the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal would have to change to zero . Newton 's laws tells us that a component of net force in the opposite direction from the goal would be necessary to reduce the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance , and since Sam 's nudge is perpendicular to the puck 's original path , there are no forces that could change the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . How does the decomposition principle apply to this situation ?
A8:motion is both horizontal and vertical
H7:Let me try again . We will first analyze the puck 's motion in the direction of the goal , and then __ _ _ _ analyze the puck 's motion in the perpendicular direction .

H2:Right ! Now let 's see if you can answer my original question in a complete sentence . How does Newton 's first law apply to the puck 's motion in the direction of the goal ?
A2:velocity is constant .
H1:After Tim hits the puck toward the goal , there are __ _ _ _ forces acting on the puck along the direction of the goal . Thus , the component of the net force on the puck along the direction of the goal is __ _ __ , and Newton 's first law applies .

PROBLEM:Tim is practicing his air hockey skills by taking shots at an unguarded goal . He hits a frictionless puck so it moves very fast directly towards the goal . His little brother Sam , standing on the side of the table , quickly nudges the puck as it passes the center of the table . The nudge is perpendicular to the original path of the puck .
H5:With this kind of nudge , could the puck 's new path ever be perpendicular to its original path ?
A5:no the puck will move diagonally
H4:Let me try again . Which principle can be applied when the motion of an object is complex , for instance , it can be thought of as motion in two perpendicular dimensions ?
A4:horizontally and vertically
H3:The decomposition principle says that the analyses of forces and motion along two __ _ _ _ directions , such as horizontal and vertical , can be done __ _ __ .
A3:perpindicular
H2:How does the decomposition principle apply to this situation ?
A2:it says that the analyses of forces and motion along two perpendicular directions , such as horizontal and vertical , can be done independently . That is , Newton 's laws can be applied in each direction separately , without affecting the analysis of the other perpendicular direction .
H1:How does the decomposition principle apply to this situation ?
A1:ou almost got it . If a component of the net force on an object is zero , the object has a constant component of velocity in that direction . ( The constant component of velocity could be either zero or non-zero. )
Q:In order for the puck 's new path to be completely perpendicular to its original path toward the goal , the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal would have to change to zero . Newton 's laws tells us that a component of net force in the opposite direction from the goal would be necessary to reduce the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance , and since Sam 's nudge is perpendicular to the puck 's original path , there are no forces that could change the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . How does the decomposition principle apply to this situation ?

Newton 's laws tells <p id = "3533_2" refid = "0">us</p> that a component of net force in the opposite direction from the goal would be necessary to reduce the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . Since <p id = "3533_3" refid = "0">we</p> assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance , and since Sam 's nudge is perpendicular to the puck 's original path , there are no forces that could change the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal .

PROBLEM:An ice skater is moving in a circle by holding a rope that 's attached to the top of a post in the ice . Right at the point in the circle when she 's moving directly toward the hot chocolate stand ( due west ) , the rope breaks .
H5:In what direction does the skater move after the rope breaks ? ( Assume the ice is very smooth so there is no friction . Ignore air resistance . )
A5:due west , toward the hot chocolate stand
H4:Maybe . We are told there is no force of friction or air resistance on the skater . And after the rope breaks , there is no longer any tension force on the skater . So are there any horizontal forces on the skater after the rope breaks ?

PROBLEM:A mover pushes a desk with constant velocity v0 across a carpeted floor . Suddenly , the mover stops pushing . What can you say about the motion of the desk after the mover stops pushing ? Explain why .
H5:Please begin by briefly answering the above question . After briefly answering the above question , please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can .
A5:The object will imeditately begin to deccelerate as the force of frictoin acting in the opposite directoin will very quickly overcome the motion of the desk eventually bringing the dest to a stop .
H4:Which Newton 's law could be useful for solving this problem and why ?
A4:first because his first law discusses equal and opposite forces and it states that an object at rest will have a nt force of zero
H3:Bravo! Why can Newton 's first law be applied to this problem ?
A3:Because when friction slows the desk to a stop , the horizontal forces balance each other out creating a net force of zero . Also , the force of gravity and the normal force already cancel each other out creating a net force of zero in the y-direction .
H2:Let me ask the previous question again and try it one more time for a more accurate answer .
A2:In the end , the horizontal forces will balance each other out creating a net force of zero in the x-direction . The forces in the y-direction are already balanced because the upward normal force from the floor cancels the downward force of gravity creating a net force of zero in the y-direction as well .

PROBLEM:Tim is practicing his air hockey skills by taking shots at an unguarded goal . He hits a frictionless puck so it moves very fast directly towards the goal . His little brother Sam , standing on the side of the table , quickly nudges the puck as it passes the center of the table . The nudge is perpendicular to the original path of the puck .
H11:With this kind of nudge , could the puck 's new path ever be perpendicular to its original path ?

H8:Let me try again . We will first analyze the puck 's motion in the direction of the goal , and then __ _ _ _ analyze the puck 's motion in the perpendicular direction . Then , we will __ _ _ _ the information about the puck 's motions in the direction of the goal and in the perpendicular direction to determine the puck 's path .
A8:.b
H7:How does Newton 's first law apply to the puck 's motion in the direction of the goal ?
A7:the net force is zero
H6:In order for the puck 's new path to be completely perpendicular to its original path toward the goal , the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal would have to change to zero . Newton 's laws tells us that a component of net force in the opposite direction from the goal would be necessary to reduce the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance , and since Sam 's nudge is perpendicular to the puck 's original path , there are no forces that could change the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . How does Newton 's first law apply to the puck 's motion in the direction of the goal ?

A3:There is no force to stop the puck from going in the direction of the goal
H2:After Tim hits the puck toward the goal , there are __ _ _ _ forces acting on the puck along the direction of the goal . Thus , the component of the net force on the puck along the direction of the goal is __ _ __ , and Newton 's first law applies . Newton 's first law tells us that the puck 's velocity along the direction of the goal is __ _ __ .
A2:.
H1:How does Newton 's first law apply to the puck 's motion perpendicular to the direction of the goal ?
A1:the object is at rest but then a force is applied
Q:Yes . We already assessed that : If a component of the net force on an object is zero , the object has a constant component of velocity in that direction . ( The constant component of velocity could be either zero or non-zero. ) After Sam nudges the puck perpendicular to the direction of the goal , are there any forces acting on the puck perpendicular to the direction of the goal ?

A7:The desk will slow down and come to a stop . The force of friction will cause the desk to slow down and then stop .
H6:If the mover stops pushing the desk , the desk will not move with constant velocity but rather with decreasing velocity as the only force acting on the desk will be friction . Friction acts in the opposite direction of the desk 's movement thus slowing the desk down . Newton 's __ _ _ _ _ _ law could be useful as we can learn about the net or total force acting on the desk when the desk was moving with constant velocity v0 .

H3:Yes . We already assessed that : After the mover stops pushing the only force acting on the desk horizontally is friction . On the vertical direction , gravity and the opposing normal force balance each other causing a constant zero velocity in that direction ( no motion ) .

PROBLEM:Tim is practicing his air hockey skills by taking shots at an unguarded goal . He hits a frictionless puck so it moves very fast directly towards the goal . His little brother Sam , standing on the side of the table , quickly nudges the puck as it passes the center of the table . The nudge is perpendicular to the original path of the puck .
H7:With this kind of nudge , could the puck 's new path ever be perpendicular to its original path ?
A7:No
H6:Let me try again . Which principle can be applied when the motion of an object is complex , for instance , it can be thought of as motion in two perpendicular dimensions ?
A6:decomposition
H5:How does the decomposition principle apply to this situation ?
A5:the is complex motion
H4:In order for the puck 's new path to be completely perpendicular to its original path toward the goal , the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal would have to change to zero . Newton 's laws tells us that a component of net force in the opposite direction from the goal would be necessary to reduce the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance , and since Sam 's nudge is perpendicular to the puck 's original path , there are no forces that could change the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . How does the decomposition principle apply to this situation ?

PROBLEM:To rescue a child who has fallen down a well , rescue workers fasten him to a rope , the other end of which is then reeled in by a machine . The rope pulls the child straight upward at steady speed . How does the amount of tension in the rope compare to the downward force of gravity acting on the child ?
H11:Please begin by briefly answering the above question . After briefly answering the above question , please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can .
A11:The tension in the rope is greater than the downward force of gravity on the child .
H10:Remember than according to Newton ?s 2nd Law , an imbalance of forces ( or a non-zero net force ) causes an object to accelerate . While its true that in order for the child to start moving , there needs to be an imbalance of forces , in this case we are asking about a moment when the child is already moving and is moving at a constant velocity . What does Newton 's first law say about an object 's motion and net force ?
A10:an object in motion stays in motion at a constant speed in a straight line unless acted upon by an unbalanced force
H9:What can you say about the net force on the kid ?

PROBLEM:A parachutist is descending vertically at a constant speed of 2 meters per second .
H10:What is the net force on her ? What are the forces that add up to make the net force ?
A10:force of air resistance is upwards and the force of gravity is downwards . The net force is downwards that is why the person continues to fall
H9:Which of Newton 's laws can be applied in this situation ?
A9:net force is equal to the mass times that acceleration
H8:Which of Newton 's laws can be applied in this situation ?
A8:net force is equal to the mass times that acceleration
H7:Yes . We already assessed that : Newton 's first law says that if the net force on an object is ZERO the object is either AT REST (zero velocity ) OR moves with a CONSTANT velocity in a STRAIGHT LINE. Zero net force could be the result of no force at all acting on an object or the result of BALANCED forces ( balanced forces cancel each other out by acting in opposite directions ) . Which of Newton 's laws describes motion of objects with constant velocity ?
A7:an object will remain in motion unless an alternate force is acting on it
H6:Why does Newton 's first law apply to this situation ?
A6:Because it has a netforce downwards so it falls downwards
H5:The first law applies because the parachutist moves with __ _ _ _ _ _ __velocity .
A5:constant
H4:How can you apply Newton 's 1st law to the parachutist ?
A4:it acts as a constant resistance to the force of gravity therefore the person falls at a constant velocity
H3:Yes . We already assessed that : Newton 's first law says that if the net force on an object is ZERO the object is either AT REST (zero velocity ) OR moves with a CONSTANT velocity in a STRAIGHT LINE. Zero net force could be the result of no force at all acting on an object or the result of BALANCED forces ( balanced forces cancel each other out by acting in opposite directions ) . According to Newton 's first law , what is the net force on an object moving at constant speed ?
A3:The net force is downwards
H2:Since the parachutist is moving at a constant speed , the net force on her must be __ _ _ __ .
A2:zero
H1:So , what can you say briefly about the net force on the parachutist ?
A1:the net force acting on the parachutist is zero because they are moving at a constant velocity .

PROBLEM:Tim is practicing his air hockey skills by taking shots at an unguarded goal . He hits a frictionless puck so it moves very fast directly towards the goal . His little brother Sam , standing on the side of the table , quickly nudges the puck as it passes the center of the table . The nudge is perpendicular to the original path of the puck .
H20:With this kind of nudge , could the puck 's new path ever be perpendicular to its original path ?
A20:yes
H19:In order for the puck 's new path to be completely perpendicular to its original path toward the goal , the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal would have to change to zero . Newton 's laws tells us that a component of net force in the opposite direction from the goal would be necessary to reduce the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance , and since Sam 's nudge is perpendicular to the puck 's original path , there are no forces that could change the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . Which principle can be applied when the motion of an object is complex , for instance , it can be thought of as motion in two perpendicular dimensions ?

Then , we will __ _ _ _ the information about the puck 's motions in the direction of the goal and in the perpendicular direction to determine the puck 's path .

H14:True , however Newton 's first law is even more relevant to this situation . What does Newton 's first law say ?
A14:objects do not accelerate unless a force is enacted on them
H13:How does Newton 's first law apply to the puck 's motion in the direction of the goal ?
A13:Its original velocity remains unchanged as no net force is enacted .

H11:Perfect ! Now let 's see if you can answer my original question in a complete sentence . How does Newton 's first law apply to the puck 's motion in the direction of the goal ?
A11:It remains unchanged until a force is acted
H10:After Tim hits the puck toward the goal , there are __ _ _ _ forces acting on the puck along the direction of the goal . Thus , the component of the net force on the puck along the direction of the goal is __ _ __ , and Newton 's first law applies . Newton 's first law tells us that the puck 's velocity along the direction of the goal is __ _ __ .
A10:no zero constnat

A8:no
H7:Good job ! What is the component of the net force on the puck perpendicular to the direction of the goal ?
A7:zero
H6:Right ! Now let 's see if you can answer my original question in a complete sentence . How does Newton 's first law apply to the puck 's motion perpendicular to the direction of the goal ?
A6:The puck does not change velocities until a force is exerted .
H5:After Sam nudges the puck perpendicular to the direction of the goal , there are __ _ _ _ forces acting on the puck perpendicular to the direction of the goal . Thus , the component of the net force on the puck perpendicular to the direction of the goal is __ _ __ , and Newton 's first law applies . Newton 's first law tells us that the puck 's velocity perpendicular to the direction of the goal is __ _ __ .
A5:no zero constant
H4:After Sam 's nudge , the puck has constant components of velocity in BOTH the direction of the goal and perpendicular to the direction of the goal . So could the puck 's new path ever be completely perpendicular to the direction of the goal ?
A4:no
H3:Let me try again . How would you describe the angle between the puck 's new path and the direction of the goal ?
A3:No, because the original horizontal velocity must be cancelled in order to produce a perpendicular motion .
H2:What principle can be applied when analyzing motion in perpendicular directions such as horizontal and vertical directions ?
A2:The decomposition principle allows you to treat the vertical and horizontal components of the velocity as separate entities .
H1:How does the decomposition principle apply to this situation ?
A1:The force exerted by the nudge does not change the original horizontal velocity component , because it only affects the force magnitude perpendicular to the original .
Q:Yes . We already assessed that : If a component of the net force on an object is zero , the object has a constant component of velocity in that direction . ( The constant component of velocity could be either zero or non-zero. ) We will first analyze the puck 's motion in the direction of the goal , and then __ _ _ _ analyze the puck 's motion in the perpendicular direction .

A1:Gravity and normal force are acting on the puck . The Earth 's gravity is pulling the puck downward and according to Newton 's Third Law of Motion , another force must be applied in the opposite direction to prevent the puck from accelerating downward . This balancing force is called the normal force , and is applied by the ice in an upwards direction .
Q:Which of Newton 's laws is relevant to this problem and why ?
A:The First and Third Laws are relevant . The first Law because <np id="2268_1" min="puck">the puck</np> is at rest , therefore the net force must be zero , and the third law because in order to have a zero net force , the downward force of gravity must have an equal and opposite force opposing <p id = "2268_2 " refid = "2268_1">it</p> .

H4:Please begin by briefly answering the above question . After briefly answering the above question , please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can .
A4:The meteor will move in the same direction as the force being applied onto it by the rocket . We know this because Newton 's first law states an object in motion or at rest will stay that way until the force acts upon it . In this case , the rocket is applying a force and therefore the object will go in that direction .
H3:Can you articulate Newton 's second law ?
A3:Newton 's second law is the net force on an object will be equal to the mass of that object times the acceleration
H2:Given the non-zero net force acting on the meteor , what does Newton 's second law say about the acceleration of the meteor ?
A2:The acceleration will be equal to the non-zero net force divided by the mass
H1:Yes . We already assessed that : Newton 's second law says that NET FORCE equals MASS times ACCELERATION. According to Newton 's second law , the non-zero net force acting on the meteor will make it move with __ _ _ _ acceleration in the direction of the net force , which is the same direction as the rocket 's push .
A1:positive
Q:Given that the meteor starts at rest and then has a constant acceleration , what else can you say about <np id="2010_1" min="meteor">the meteor</np> 's motion ?

PROBLEM:An airplane is flying on a windy day . The thrust from the plane 's engines is balanced by air resistance such that the plane has a constant component of velocity toward due south . Also , a crosswind pushes the plane with a constant velocity toward due west .

H1:The decomposition principle says that the analyses of forces and motion along two __ _ _ _ directions , such as horizontal and vertical , can be done __ _ __ .
A1:different
Q:How does the decomposition principle apply to this situation ?
A:The decomposition principle says that the analyses of forces and motion along two perpendicular directions , such as horizontal and vertical , can be done independently . That is , Newton 's laws can be applied in each direction separately , without affecting the analysis of the other perpendicular direction . Whether the quarter lands in Chris 's hand depends on the relative horizontal motions of the quarter and Chris 's hand . The decomposition principle tells <p id = "3274_1" refid = "0">us</p> that the vertical direction is not relevant to the analysis of horizontal motion . Thus , no analysis of the vertical direction is needed to answer the question . The wagon , Chris , Chris 's hand , and the quarter all have the same constant horizontal component of velocity both before and after the throw . <np id="3274_1" min="quarter and Chris">The quarter and Chris</np> 's relative horizontal positions are identical as <p id = "3274_2" refid = "3274_1">they </p> have all the time equal horizontal velocities and start at the same position initially , at the moment of the throw . Since Chris 's hand and the quarter travel equal horizontal distances in equal times , the quarter will land in Chris 's hand

H2:Please begin by briefly answering the above question . After briefly answering the above question , please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can .
A2:the tension is the rope is less than that of the downward force of gravity
H1:Remember that tension and downward force of gravity are both vectors . In order for two vectors to be equal , the magnitude and the direction have to be the same .

A1:The object will accelerate . It will continue to accelerate because according to Newton 's 2nd law , the net force is equal to the mass times acceleration , so acceleration is equal to the net force divided by the mass .

PROBLEM:Tim is practicing his air hockey skills by taking shots at an unguarded goal . He hits a frictionless puck so it moves very fast directly towards the goal . His little brother Sam , standing on the side of the table , quickly nudges the puck as it passes the center of the table . The nudge is perpendicular to the original path of the puck .
H9:With this kind of nudge , could the puck 's new path ever be perpendicular to its original path ?
A9:yes
H8:In order for the puck 's new path to be completely perpendicular to its original path toward the goal , the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal would have to change to zero . Newton 's laws tells us that a component of net force in the opposite direction from the goal would be necessary to reduce the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance , and since Sam 's nudge is perpendicular to the puck 's original path , there are no forces that could change the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . Which principle can be applied when the motion of an object is complex , for instance , it can be thought of as motion in two perpendicular dimensions ?

PROBLEM:To rescue a child who has fallen down a well , rescue workers fasten him to a rope , the other end of which is then reeled in by a machine .

H12:Please begin by briefly answering the above question . After briefly answering the above question , please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can .
A12:the tension is greater than the downward force
H11:Remember than according to Newton ?s 2nd Law , an imbalance of forces ( or a non-zero net force ) causes an object to accelerate . While its true that in order for the child to start moving , there needs to be an imbalance of forces , in this case we are asking about a moment when the child is already moving and is moving at a constant velocity . Which of Newton 's laws is most relevant to this situation ?
A11:second
H10:True , however Newton 's first law is even more relevant to this situation . What does Newton 's first law say ?
A10:objects in motion stay in motion and object at rest stay at rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force
H9:What can you say about the net force on the kid ?

H8:What do you mean by "it " ? Please type only the replacement word or phrase .
A8:the net force is not zero
H7:Remember that tension and downward force of gravity are both vectors . In order for two vectors to be equal , the magnitude and the direction have to be the same . In this case , the tension is upward and gravity is downward . The MAGNITUDES of these vectors can be equal , but the vectors cannot be equal . What can you say about the net force on the kid ?

PROBLEM:Two sisters are on a ledge over a deep swimming pool . Sue , the younger and smaller sister , takes a running start and goes straight off the ledge . Paulette , the older and larger sister , simply steps off the ledge at the same moment that Sue leaves the ledge .
H1:Which sister will hit the water first ?
A1:The decomposition principle says that the analyses of forces and motion along two perpendicular directions , such as horizontal and vertical , can be done independently . That is , Newton 's laws can be applied in each direction separately , without affecting the analysis of the other perpendicular direction . Since the problem asks which stone will hit the water first , the only important direction for us to analyze is the vertical direction . The decomposition principle tells us that we do n't really need to analyze the horizontal direction at all in this particular problem because of the question asked . When only gravity is acting on an object it is said to be in freefall . All objects near the surface of the earth freefall with the same constant downward acceleration regardless of mass ( neglecting air resistance ) . Once Sarah throws her stone , gravity is the only force acting on Sarah 's stone (ignoring air resistance ) . Once Billy drops his stone , gravity is the only force acting on Billy 's stone (ignoring air resistance ) . Thus , both stones are in freefall and have the same constant acceleration due to gravity . Since the stones have the same constant acceleration due to gravity and are released from the same height at the same time , both stones will hit the water at the same time .
Q:Bravo! Why is the decomposition principle relevant here ?
A:The decomposition principle is relevant because  <np id = "2998_1" min="apple">the apple </np> is in free fall , which means will move vertically towards the Earth , and also <p id = "2998_2" refid = "2998_1">it</p> moves horizontally because <p id = "2998_3" refid = "2998_1">it</p> has a horizontal velocity at the moment <p id = "2998_3" refid = "2998_1">it</p> leaves Susan 's hand .

PROBLEM:Tim is practicing his air hockey skills by taking shots at an unguarded goal . He hits a frictionless puck so it moves very fast directly towards the goal . His little brother Sam , standing on the side of the table , quickly nudges the puck as it passes the center of the table . The nudge is perpendicular to the original path of the puck .
H4:With this kind of nudge , could the puck 's new path ever be perpendicular to its original path ?
A4:yes
H3:In order for the puck 's new path to be completely perpendicular to its original path toward the goal , the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal would have to change to zero . Newton 's laws tells us that a component of net force in the opposite direction from the goal would be necessary to reduce the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance , and since Sam 's nudge is perpendicular to the puck 's original path , there are no forces that could change the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal .

The plane 's motion along the north-south direction can be analyzed separately from the plane 's motion along the east-west direction . The result of the analysis along these two perpendicular directions is combined to determine the plane 's overall path of motion . The plane will travel in a straight line , because the combination of constant velocity components to the south and west give the plane 's path a constant slope . The plane would be moving in a straight line to the southwest , combining the plane 's components of velocity to the south and to the west .

PROBLEM:A rocket pushes a meteor with constant force . Assume that the meteor is initially at rest and is far enough away from the sun and the planets to neglect gravity . How will the meteor move ?
H1:Please begin by briefly answering the above question . After briefly answering the above question , please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can .
A1:Thw meteor will move due to the force supplied by the rocket . Newton 's first law tells us that an object at rest ( with a velocity of zero ) will remain at rest unless acted upon by an outside force . The thrusters of the rocket will propell the rocket and in turn cuase the meteor to have a net force in the direction of the rocket 's motion causeing the meteor to move .

PROBLEM:Tim is practicing his air hockey skills by taking shots at an unguarded goal . He hits a frictionless puck so it moves very fast directly towards the goal . His little brother Sam , standing on the side of the table , quickly nudges the puck as it passes the center of the table . The nudge is perpendicular to the original path of the puck .
H6:With this kind of nudge , could the puck 's new path ever be perpendicular to its original path ?
A6:No the puck 's new path could never be perpendicular to its original path
H5:What principle can be applied when analyzing motion in perpendicular directions such as horizontal and vertical directions ?
A5:The decomposition principle and Newton 's First Law

A4:Since the puck 's new path is both horizontal and vertical , then the velocity vector of the path can be broken up as such
H3:In order for the puck 's new path to be completely perpendicular to its original path toward the goal , the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal would have to change to zero . Newton 's laws tells us that a component of net force in the opposite direction from the goal would be necessary to reduce the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance , and since Sam 's nudge is perpendicular to the puck 's original path , there are no forces that could change the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal . How does the decomposition principle apply to this situation ?

PROBLEM:A mover pushes a desk with constant velocity v0 across a carpeted floor . Suddenly , the mover stops pushing . What can you say about the motion of the desk after the mover stops pushing ? Explain why .
Q:Please begin by briefly answering the above question . After briefly answering the above question , please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can .
A:<np id = "1262_1" min="velocity">The desk 's velocity </np> will decrease until <p id = "1262_2" refid = "1262_1">it</p> reaches zero because after the force ceases to be applied , the net force will be the force of friction , which acts on the desk in the opposite direction that the force was applied . Newton 's Second Law of Motion states that the object will accelerate in the direction of the net force , therefore the desk 's velocity will decrease .
