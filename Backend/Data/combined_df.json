    "QuestionText": "What is the value of x in the equation csch(x) = 2?",
    "Answer": "csch^-1(0.5)",
    "Difficulty": 2,
    "Explanation": "The hyperbolic cosecant function is the reciprocal of the hyperbolic sine function. In this case, csch(x) = 2 means that sinh(x) = 0.5, which means that x = sinh^-1(0.5), which is the inverse hyperbolic sine function."
